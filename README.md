##swift-script

This is my first try on the shell-script language, maybe not good, but i like to regard it as a long run.

This is a script for the swift to be installed on the ubuntu-series(using a loopback device for storage, and without setting up rsyslog for individual logging), and it is supposed to run as the root.

Detailed information is as followed:

1. swift1.sh focuses on installing dependencies;

2. swift2.sh prapares for the loopback device and to setup the common post-device;

3. swift3.sh gets the swift codes and install them(this is the most like to have installation errors);

4. swift4.sh sets up the rsync and starts memcached;

5. swift5.sh configures each node;

6. swift6.sh sets up part srcipts for running swift and you should run the 10-th and below by yourself.

Much improvements needed for such version.
